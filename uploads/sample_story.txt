Title: The Whispering Library

In a quiet village tucked between misty hills, there stood an ancient library no one dared to enter after sunset.
Legends whispered that the books could talk, revealing secrets of those who dared to read them at night.

One evening, young Mira, a curious girl with a love for stories, tiptoed inside just as the sun dipped below the horizon.
The moment she touched the oldest book on the shelf, the library stirred. Pages fluttered, and voices murmured from every corner.

The book opened itself and began telling Mira a tale — not of heroes or dragons, but of her own future. 
It spoke of journeys she would take, people she would meet, and choices that would shape the world.

As dawn approached, the voices fell silent. Mira left the library, forever changed.

From that day on, the villagers noticed a sparkle in her eyes — the kind only seen in those who carry the weight of true stories.

The end.
